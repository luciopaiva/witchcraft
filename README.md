Think Greasemonkey for developers.

Witchcraft is a Google Chrome extension that allows loading custom JavaScript and CSS scripts right from your file system, automatically injecting them into target pages.

It works by matching every page domain against script file names available in the scripts folder. For instance, if one navigates to `https://www.google.com`, Witchcraft will try to load and run `google.com.js` and `google.com.css`.

For more information on how to install and use it, head to Witchcraft's [home page](http://luciopaiva.com/witchcraft).

Witchcraft is my rendition of [defunkt](https://github.com/defunkt)'s original extension, [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs). Although I never got to actually use dotjs (it only worked for MacOS and the installation process was not easy), I really wanted something like that. Thanks, defunkt, for having such a cool idea.

Thanks [arimus](https://github.com/arimus) for the idea of using Web Server for Chrome.
