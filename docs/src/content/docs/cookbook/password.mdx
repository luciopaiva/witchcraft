title: Filling in unconventional password fields

Some websites use unconventional methods to handle password inputs, which can prevent standard password managers from recognizing and filling these fields. This guide will help you create a Witchcraft script to automatically fill in such password fields.

Let's say you encounter a website that requires an 8-character password but then asks you to fill in only specific, random character positions from that password:

<Card>
    <div class="password-container">
        <label for="p1">3rd:</label>
        <input type="password" id="p1" maxlength="1" class="password-field" />
        <label for="p2">5th:</label>
        <input type="password" id="p2" maxlength="1" class="password-field" />
        <label for="p3">1st:</label>
        <input type="password" id="p3" maxlength="1" class="password-field" />
    </div>
</Card>

The password manager will either try to fill the fields (incorrectly) or none at all. To solve this, you can create a Witchcraft script that injects a temporary password field into the page, allowing the password manager to fill it in. Once filled, the script can then read the necessary characters and populate the actual fields.

<Code title="script.js" lang="js" code={temporaryPasswordScript} />

## Variant: a virtual keyboard

A variant of this problem is when the website provides a virtual keyboard for password entry, which can also prevent password managers from functioning correctly.

The solution is similar: to inject a temporary password field into the page so that the password manager can fill it in. Once filled, the script can then read every character and press the corresponding keys on the virtual keyboard.
