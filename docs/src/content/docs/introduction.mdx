Witchcraft is a Google Chrome extension for loading custom JavaScript and CSS directly from a folder on your local machine, injecting them into web pages that match specified URL patterns.

Pattern-matching is done using the page's URL. You can target specific pages, partial or entire domains. For example, navigating to `https://google.com` will match `google.com.js` and `google.com.css`:

<Image src={exampleImage} alt="Witchcraft screenshot" />

For the screenshot above, the following scripts were used:

<Code code={exampleJs} lang="javascript" title="google.com.js" />

<Code code={exampleCss} lang="javascript" title="google.com.css" />

Actual practical uses include getting rid of nasty ads, automating clicks and improving page layouts with your own CSS rules. You're only limited by what Javascript and CSS can do.
