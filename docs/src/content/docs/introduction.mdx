Witchcraft is a Google Chrome extension for loading custom JavaScript and CSS directly from a folder on your local machine, injecting them into web pages that match specified URL patterns.

Pattern-matching is done using the page's URL. You can target specific pages, partial or entire domains. For example, navigating to `https://google.com` will match `google.com.js` and `google.com.css`:

<Image src={exampleImage} alt="Witchcraft screenshot" />

For the screenshot above, the following scripts were used:

<Code code={exampleJs} lang="javascript" title="google.com.js" />

<Code code={exampleCss} lang="javascript" title="google.com.css" />

Actual practical uses include getting rid of nasty ads, automating clicks and improving page layouts with your own CSS rules. You're only limited by what Javascript and CSS can do.

## Main features

This is what makes Witchcraft different than other similar extensions:

- **JavaScript <u>and CSS</u> injection**

  Witchcraft is not only able to run Javascript, but also CSS;

- **editing scripts is easy**

  Just edit your scripts in your favorite editor and refresh the page;

- **cross-platform**

  Since Witchcraft runs as a Chrome extension, it is runs on any platform that supports Chrome extensions (Linux, Windows, MacOS);

- **runs on all Chromium-based browsers**

  Witchcraft should work on any Chromium-based browser that supports extensions, such as Microsoft Edge, Brave and Opera;

- **runs on all frames**

  Witchcraft will inject your scripts into all frames of the page, including iframes;

- **runs on the page's context**

  Witchcraft runs your scripts in the page's context, giving you full access to the page's JavaScript environment;

- **open source**

  Witchcraft is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/luciopaiva/witchcraft). That means you can load it directly into Chrome as an unpacked extension, if you prefer (which is not the case for other popular extensions like Tampermonkey, which was turned closed source).
