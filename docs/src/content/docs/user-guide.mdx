Once your Witchcraft is [set up](/how-to-install), you can start creating scripts. This guide will help you understand how Witchcraft looks for scripts and how to name them properly.

To give you a basic idea of how it works, let's use as an example the page `https://gist.github.com`. Once you navigate to that page, Witchcraft will kick in and look for scripts to inject. This is what it will look for, in order:

- `_global.js` (see "Global scripts" below)
- `_global.css`
- `com.js`
- `com.css`
- `github.com.js`
- `github.com.css`
- `gist.github.com.js`
- `gist.github.com.css`

For each candidate script above, Witchcraft will make a request to your local server (the one you set up in the [installation guide](/how-to-install)) to see if the script exists. If it does, it will be injected into the page. If it doesn't, Witchcraft will move on to the next candidate script.

# Path segments

Witchcraft also tries to match path segments. For example, if you navigate to https://example.com/foo/bar.html, the following paths will be looked up, after being concatenated with each of the domain-based candidates above:

- `foo.js`
- `foo.css`
- `foo/bar.html.js`
- `foo/bar.html.css`

# Global scripts

Witchcraft also looks for two special global scripts that are injected into every page, regardless of the domain or path:

- `_global.js`
- `_global.css`

Moreover, if you have a folder named `_global` in your scripts directory, Witchcraft will look for scripts inside that folder as well, trying to match them against the path segments. For example, if you navigate to `https://example.com/foo/bar.html`, the following paths will be looked up inside the `_global` folder:

- `_global/foo.js`
- `_global/foo.css`
- `_global/foo/bar.html.js`
- `_global/foo/bar.html.css`

# Script lookup order

Now that we went through all the different types of scripts Witchcraft looks for, let's summarize the full lookup order when navigating to a page. Let's use `https://example.com/foo/bar.html` as an example again. The full lookup order will be:

1. `_global.js`
2. `_global.css`
3. `_global/foo.js`
4. `_global/foo.css`
5. `_global/foo/bar.html.js`
6. `_global/foo/bar.html.css`
7. `com.js`
8. `com.css`
9. `com/foo.js`
10. `com/foo.css`
11. `com/foo/bar.html.js`
12. `com/foo/bar.html.css`
13. `example.com.js`
14. `example.com.css`
15. `example.com/foo.js`
16. `example.com/foo.css`
17. `example.com/foo/bar.html.js`
18. `example.com/foo/bar.html.css`
