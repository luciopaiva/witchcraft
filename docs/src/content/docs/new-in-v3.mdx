title: New in v3
---

Witchcraft has been completely revamped to work with [MV3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3). All outstanding bugs have been fixed and old users should be able to use it just fine now.

For those that were using the old Web Server Chrome app, be aware that it now only works on ChromeOS. Please see the installation page for alternatives.
