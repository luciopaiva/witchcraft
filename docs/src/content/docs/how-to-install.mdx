Follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Install Witchcraft Chrome extension: get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/witchcraft-inject-js-and/hokcepcfcicnhalinladgknhaljndhpc)

2. Choose a local folder where your scripts will be stored. For instance, `~/witchcraft-scripts` (create it now if it doesn't exist yet)

3. Start a local web server to serve that folder. You can use any web server you like, but here are some simple options:

   - Python 3 (if you have Python installed):

     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 5743
     ```

   - Node.js (if you have Node.js installed):

     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     http-server -p 5743
     ```

   <Aside type="caution">
       By default, Witchcraft uses port `5743`. If you choose a different port, make sure to change it in the extension's settings by clicking on the Witchcraft icon in the Chrome toolbar and updating the server address field.

   A comprehensive list of options can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).

</Steps>

As soon as Witchcraft is able to reach the server, the status indicator will turn green:

You can now [create a script](/introduction) in your scripts folder and open the corresponding web page to see it in action.
