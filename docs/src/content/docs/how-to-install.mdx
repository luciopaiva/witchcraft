Follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Install Witchcraft Chrome extension: get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/witchcraft-inject-js-and/hokcepcfcicnhalinladgknhaljndhpc)

2. Choose a local folder where your scripts will be stored. For instance, `~/witchcraft-scripts` (create it now if it doesn't exist yet)

3. Start a local web server to serve that folder. You can use any web server you like, but here are some simple options:

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="python" label="Python" icon="seti:python">
            ```bash
            python3 -m http.server 5743
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js" icon="node">
            ```bash
            npx http-server . -p 5743
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="wsl2" label="WSL2" icon="seti:windows">
            A WSL2 bash script + Windows Task Scheduler to auto-start it. See details [here](/wsl2-python-server).
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="homelab" label="Docker" icon="seti:docker">
            ```yml title="docker-compose.yml" ins="./witchcraft-scripts"
            version: "3.9"
            services:
              web:
                image: nginx:alpine
                container_name: simple-web
                ports:
                  - "5743:80"
                volumes:
                  - ./witchcraft-scripts:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
            ```

            Just make sure to change `./witchcraft-scripts` to the correct path of your scripts folder.

            <details>
                <summary>Homelab alternative</summary>
                A wild idea is to run a Docker container in your homelab (in case you have one) and then mount the remote scripts folder as a local volume on your machine, this way you can have a single scripts folder that is shared across multiple devices on your network. Just make sure to set Witchcraft to point to the correct server address instead of the default `127.0.0.1`.

        <TabItem value="other" label="More" icon="rocket">
            A comprehensive list of ways to start a web server can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
</Steps>

## Checking that everything is working

As soon as Witchcraft is able to reach the server, the status indicator will turn green:

<Image src={serverOnlineImage} alt="Witchcraft server online indicator" />

If it doesn't, check that the server address is correct. Witchcraft will look for the server at `http://127.0.0.1:5743`. If you choose a different port (or start the server in a different machine), make sure to configure it accordingly in the extension's settings by clicking on the Witchcraft icon in the Chrome toolbar and updating the server address field.

You can now [create a script](/introduction) in your scripts folder and open the corresponding web page to see it in action.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to ask for help [here](https://github.com/luciopaiva/witchcraft/issues).
