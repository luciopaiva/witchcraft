Witchcraft is my rendition of [defunkt](https://github.com/defunkt)'s original extension, [dotjs](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs). Although I never got to actually use dotjs (it only worked on macOS and the installation process was not easy), I really wanted something like that. defunkt now kindly [mentions](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs/blob/master/README.markdown) Witchcraft as the go-to alternative to dotjs.
